# ISON Language Readme

The ISON language is a functional programming language that lives within the JSON or JSON5 syntax specification. That is, every ISON script file can be read as a standard JSON file. The ISON syntax only appears in strings within the JSON file. This syntax highlighting supports the JSON5 standard and the ISON extensions.
